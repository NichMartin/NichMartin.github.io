I’m Nich (pronounced Nick) Martin, and I’m a postdoctoral associate at the Florida Museum of Natural History at the University of Florida, under the advisement of Nicolas Gauthier.\nBroadly, I am an evolutionary biologist and ecologist using a combination of theory, mathematics, statistics, and computational methods, including but not limited to agent-based modeling and machine learning, with data collected by me, my collaborators, citizen scientists, and historical documents to understand ecological processes and evolutionary dilemmas.\nMy interests span broadly across the life sciences and include areas such as disease dynamics, chemical ecology, behavioral ecology, predator-prey interactions, and plant-herbivore interactions. I work with a range of different organisms including vertebrates, invertebrates, plants, and bacteria. For a more detailed look at some of current or recently completed work, check out my PROJECTS link (coming soon)."
