    "text": "I am a postdoctoral associate at the Florida Museum of Natural History at the University of Florida, under the advisement of Nicolas Gauthier.\nBroadly, I am an ecologist and evolutionary biologist who uses a combination of theory, mathematics, statistics, and computational methods (e.g., agent-based and machine learning models), with data collected by me, collaborators, publicly repositories, and historical records to understand ecological processes and evolutionary dilemmas.\nMy interests span broadly across the life sciences and include areas such as disease dynamics, chemical and behavioral ecology, predator-prey interactions, and plant-herbivore interactions. I work with a range of different organisms including vertebrates, invertebrates, plants, and bacteria. For a more detailed look at some of my current or recently completed work, check out my PROJECTS link (coming soon)."
